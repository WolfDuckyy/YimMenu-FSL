IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!!!

Rockstar Games just released an Update of "Rockstar Games SDK" in the RGL launcher.
and I think they patched the loohole to use FSL to get inro GTA Online.

I'd suggest to not use YimMenu again,

I'll look forward to find another trick to use YImMenu, or maybe never
WHo knows

kudos.....
