This repository will guide you on how to use YimMenu in GTA Online by ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-cheat which was implemented on Sept. 17, 2024 Title Update of GTA V.

I will provide the steps in order for you to use YimMenu in GTA Online with ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-Cheat.



As you know, on September 17th, 2024, Rockstar Games released a new Title Update for GTA V which implemented the new BattleEye Anti-Cheat functionality. 
They literally brought this update after 10 years which is a literal joke XD.

and as we all know, YimMenu's Git Repository was hit with DMCA take down by Take 2 Interactive.
So now yimura will only provide binary releases at there official page at [www.unknowncheats.me]

**Step 1:**

**Download Prerequisites**

You'll need the following files downloaded:

Dropbox Folder Link: 
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/hkllxdj8p94hpwhp0anec/ADgXfPJpg-gPTkgJLxz2Fjs?rlkey=yeci69blmit7z5h4ar27l6wmz&st=lg19p9wn&dl=0


1. **YimMenu dev build**:
   
   YimMenu's dev build is required for now because the current game version is 1.69-335
   and the YimMenu's current UC release only supports the 1.69-3337 game version.
   YimMenu's dev build link: (optional)
   https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eg66e7ngk9aie0hmnswo7/YimMenu-dev-9b422e09e973bb3ddf5d69a2625b197e93eb945c.dll?rlkey=ukpalfuskl2gzmk7oj98k9wyd&st=gbvqiao9&dl=0

3. **Xenos Injector**:

   Inside the dropbox folder link provided, there are 2 Xenos exe's ( Xenos and Xenos64 )

4. **FSL: Local GTAO Saves**

   FSL is a tool that helps you store your GTA Online multiplayer data locally on your hard drive!
   FSL Link: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=47299

All three files are listed for download are required to use YImMenu!

**Step 2:**

**Disable BattleEye**

In order to use YimMenu, you need to disable BattleEye for GTA V
  1. Open Rockstar Games Launcher
  2. Go to Settings tab
  3. Scroll down and uncheck the BattleEye option to disable it.
  4. If you play gta online under different distributor like Steam or Epic Games,
     then just open or create the file named "commandline" and add "-nobattleeye" flag into the file and save it.
  5. (optional) You can also add "nobattleeye" argument in Rockstar Games Launcher too, not necessarily!
This will disable the BattleEye launcher and you can play GTA Online without BattleEye!


**Step 3:**
**FSL**
   
 1. Download the FSL tool from the provided UC link above.
 2. The link will download a dll file named as "version.vmp_[unknowncheats.me]_.dll"
   All you need to do is rename the dll to "version.dll".
 3. After renaming the file, you need to copy/paste the file into
    the GTA V Directory.
 4. The dll file will be automatically injected into the game when the game launches.
 5. You need to play GTA Online with FSL Tool running for once atleast,
in order for your save data to be saved locally. Then you can backup the saved data which is recommmended.
the Location is **%APPDATA/Roaming/FSL%"**.

**"note: as FSL saves the multiplayer data locally, it will use only the locally saved data to 
run GTA Online and won't touch the data on the GTA Online Servers!"**


**Step 4:**
**Inject YimMenu**
 
 Once the FSL tool is set up, now you are ready to use YimMenu in your game!
 1. Download the Xenos Injector from the dropbox link provided. (I don't know but only this version of Xenos works to inject YimMenu's dev build)
