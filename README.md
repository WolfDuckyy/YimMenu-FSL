This repository will guide you on how to use YimMenu in GTA Online by ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-cheat which was implemented on Sept. 17, 2024 Title Update of GTA V.

I will provide the steps in order for you to use YimMenu in GTA Online with ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-Cheat.



As you know, on September 17th, 2024, Rockstar Games released a new Title Update for GTA V which implemented the new BattleEye Anti-Cheat functionality. 
They literally brought this update after 10 years which is a literal joke XD.

and as we all know, YimMenu's Git Repository was hit with DMCA take down by Take 2 Interactive.
So now yimura will only provide binary releases at there official page at [www.unknowncheats.me]

**Step 1:**

**Prerequisites**

You'll need the following files downloaded:

1. **YimMenu dev build**:
   
   YimMenu's dev build is required for now because the current game version is 1.69-335
   and the YimMenu's current UC release only supports the 1.69-3337 game version.
   YimMenu's dev build: [https://github.com/WolfDuckyy/YimMenu-FSL/blob/main/YimMenu-dev-9b422e09e973bb3ddf5d69a2625b197e93eb945c.dll](url)

3. **Xenos Injector**:

   This version of Xenos will work to inject the dev build of YimMenu.
   Xenos : [https://github.com/WolfDuckyy/YimMenu-FSL/blob/main/Xenos.exe](url)
   Xenos64: [https://github.com/WolfDuckyy/YimMenu-FSL/blob/main/Xenos64.exe](url)
