This repository will guide you on how to use YimMenu in GTA Online by ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-cheat which was implemented on Sept. 17, 2024 Title Update of GTA V.

I will provide the steps in order for you to use YimMenu in GTA Online with ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-Cheat.



As you know, on September 17th, 2024, Rockstar Games released a new Title Update for GTA V which implemented the new BattleEye Anti-Cheat functionality. 
They literally brought this update after 10 years which is a literal joke XD.

and as we all know, YimMenu's Git Repository was hit with DMCA take down by Take 2 Interactive.
So now yimura will only provide binary releases at there official page at [www.unknowncheats.me]

**Step 1:**

**Prerequisites**

You'll need the following files downloaded:

Dropbox Link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/hkllxdj8p94hpwhp0anec/ADgXfPJpg-gPTkgJLxz2Fjs?rlkey=yeci69blmit7z5h4ar27l6wmz&st=lg19p9wn&dl=0


1. **YimMenu dev build**:
   
   YimMenu's dev build is required for now because the current game version is 1.69-335
   and the YimMenu's current UC release only supports the 1.69-3337 game version.
   YimMenu's dev build: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eg66e7ngk9aie0hmnswo7/YimMenu-dev-9b422e09e973bb3ddf5d69a2625b197e93eb945c.dll?rlkey=ukpalfuskl2gzmk7oj98k9wyd&st=gbvqiao9&dl=0

2. **Xenos Injector**:

   Inside the dropbox folder link provided, there are 2 Xenos exe's ( Xenos and Xenos64 )

3. **FSL: Local GTAO Saves**

   FSL is a tool that helps you store your GTA Online multiplayer data locally on your hard drive!
   FSL Link: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=47299

All three files are listed for download are required to use YImMenu!

**Step 2:**

After downloading all the files,
First you need to do is make use of FSL tool, it will help you to save your gta online data locally,
at "**%APPDATA/Roaming/FSL%"**
FSL will help you to play GTA Online without the BattleEye and protects your from getting banned!
"note: as FSL saves the multiplayer data locally, it will use only the locally saved data to run GTA Online and won't touch the data on the GTA Online Servers!"
 1. Download the FSL tool from the provided UC link above.
 2. The link will download a dll file named as "version.vmp_[unknowncheats.me]_.dll"
   All you need to do is rename the dll to "version.dll".
 3. After renaming the file, you need to copy/paste the file into 


4. **Step 3:**

**Disable BattleEye**

In order to use YimMenu, you need to disable BattleEye for GTA V
  1. Open Rockstar Games Launcher
  2. Go to Settings tab
  3. Scroll down and uncheck the BattleEye option to disable it.
  4. If you play gta online under different distributor like Steam or Epic Games,
     then just open or create the file named "commandline" and add "-nobattleeye" flag into the file and save it.
This will disable the BattleEye launcher to run with GTA V!
