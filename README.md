This repository will guide you on how to use YimMenu in GTA Online by ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-cheat which was implemented on Sept. 17, 2024 Title Update of GTA V.

I will provide the steps in order for you to use YimMenu in GTA Online with ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-Cheat.



As you know, on September 17th, 2024, Rockstar Games released a new Title Update for GTA V which implemented the new BattleEye Anti-Cheat functionality. 
They literally brought this update after 10 years which is a literal joke XD.

and as we all know, YimMenu's Git Repository was hit with DMCA take down by Take 2 Interactive.
So now yimura will only provide binary releases at there official page at [www.unknowncheats.me]

**Step 1:**

**Prerequisites**

You'll need the following files downloaded:

Dropbox Link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/hkllxdj8p94hpwhp0anec/ADgXfPJpg-gPTkgJLxz2Fjs?rlkey=yeci69blmit7z5h4ar27l6wmz&st=lg19p9wn&dl=0


1. **YimMenu dev build**:
   
   YimMenu's dev build is required for now because the current game version is 1.69-335
   and the YimMenu's current UC release only supports the 1.69-3337 game version.
   YimMenu's dev build: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eg66e7ngk9aie0hmnswo7/YimMenu-dev-9b422e09e973bb3ddf5d69a2625b197e93eb945c.dll?rlkey=ukpalfuskl2gzmk7oj98k9wyd&st=gbvqiao9&dl=0

2. **Xenos Injector**:

   Inside the dropbox folder link provided, there are 2 Xenos exe's ( Xenos and Xenos64 )

3. **FSL: Local GTAO Saves**

   FSL is a tool that helps you store your GTA Online multiplayer data locally on your hard drive!
   FSL Link: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/downloads.php?do=file&id=47299


   The link will download a dll file named as "version.vmp_[unknowncheats.me]_.dll"
   All you need to do is rename the dll to "version.dll"
