I will provide the steps in order for you to use YimMenu in GTA Online with ByPassing the BattleEye Anti-Cheat.



As you know, on September 17th, 2024, Rockstar Games released a new Title Update for GTA V which implemented the new BattleEye Anti-Cheat functionality. 
They literally brought this update after 10 years which is a literal joke XD.

and as we all know, YimMenu's Git Repository was hit with DMCA take down by Take 2 Interactive. So now yimura will only provide binary releases at there official page at [https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/476972-yimmenu-1-69-b3337.html](url)
